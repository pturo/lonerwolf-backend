## What's new?

There is no new features.

## About project

This is a modified Reddit clone app with my own API made with this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKlTBBuc32c

This project was made with Java 8 and MSSQL database. API was generated by using Swagger framework. 
One thing you will need to do is paste your own configuration in application.properties. There is configuration for
database (I used SQL Server Driver, you can use something else like MySQL Driver) and credentials to mailtrap.io 
which I removed due to data privacy. When you will have your credentials from mailtrap.io, paste there.

To run this application, first build your project (by letting Maven download and install important dependencies from
pom.xml file) and then hit 'Run' option in Intellij IDEA.

You can test your API, launcing Swagger UI here: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

## Technologies used in the project

* Java 8
* SQL Management Studio
* Swagger

## Goals

The goal of this project is trying to build own service like Reddit and learn about creating models, views, controllers, user authentication and application security.
